===================================PROJECT : PWM Sine Wave Inverter==============================
It took 3 days to optimize initial working code to final working code...
Embedded C was new to me but it was a task I had taken up and couldn't go backwards.
Optimization was a success, project simulation was a success...
Well, hardware simulations were never done much.
